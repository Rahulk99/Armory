The Armory is a comprehensive suite of tools for network security and penetration testing, designed for use by security professionals and researchers.
The project includes five modules, each designed to perform a specific function:


1 Mac Address Changer: Allows users to change the Media Access Control (MAC) address of their network interface, providing a layer of anonymity.

2 Integrated Network and Port Scanner: Scans a network for live hosts and open ports, providing a comprehensive view of the network's security posture.

3 ARP Spoofer: Allows users to perform ARP spoofing attacks, redirecting traffic and intercepting sensitive information.

4 Packet Sniffer: Captures and analyzes network traffic, providing insight into network activity and identifying potential security threats.

5 DNS Spoofer: Allows users to perform DNS spoofing attacks, redirecting traffic to malicious sites and potentially stealing sensitive information.

The Armory project is intended for use by security professionals and researchers to test the security of networks and identify vulnerabilities.
