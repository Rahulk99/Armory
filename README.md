# ARMORY

The Armory is a comprehensive suite of tools for network security and penetration testing, designed for use by security professionals and researchers.
The project includes five modules, each designed to perform a specific function:


1 Mac Address Changer: Allows users to change the Media Access Control (MAC) address of their network interface, providing a layer of anonymity.
